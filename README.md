### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordan Lingao and my pronouns are she/her. I am currently a student at BloomTech, studying Data Science. My interest in Data Science stems from a Computational Linguistics class that I took for my Linguistics major in college. There I was first exposed to NLP and Machine Learning.
